# My Fetch App

My Fetch App is an Android application that fetches data from a remote server, processes it, and displays it in a sorted and grouped manner. The items are grouped by `listId` and sorted first by `listId` and then by `name`. The app uses modern Android components such as `ViewBinding` and `ConstraintLayout`.
